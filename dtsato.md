I am a technologist with more than 14 years of experience in the industry. With a Masters degree in Computer Science from University of São Paulo (USP), I started working as a systems administrator, but spent most of my career writing code and working in Agile teams. When I first heard the term "DevOps" I realized that I've been working in that space for a while. Nowadays I spend my time learning, doing, and sharing my experiences with Cloud, DevOps, Continuous Delivery and Big Data with my clients and the wider software industry.

I am a consultant at [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com) since 2008, acting in various roles such as: developer, systems administrator, analyst, systems engineer, teacher, architect, and coach. Currently, I help our customers adopt practices to reduce the time between having an idea, implementing it and running it in production.

I am also an experienced speaker at international conferences, presenting talks and workshops at: 2007/2009/2010 XP, Agile 2008/2009, Ágiles 2008, Conexão Java 2007, Falando em Agile 2008, Rio On Rails 2007, PyCon Brazil 2007, RejectConf SP 2007, Rails Summit Latin America 2008, Agile Brazil 2011/2012/2013, QCon SP 2011/2013, QCon Rio 2014, RubyConf Brazil 2012/2013, RuPy 2014.  I was also the founder of the Coding Dojo @ São Paulo.

In my spare time I enjoy reading and performing magic tricks and playing the piano, guitar, and occasionally the drums.
